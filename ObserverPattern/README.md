**From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)**:
the observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject,
maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state
changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
